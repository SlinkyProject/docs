Welcome to Slinky, a set of powerful integration tools designed to bring Slurm capabilities into Kubernetes. Whether youâ€™re managing high-performance computing (HPC) workloads or operating within cloud-native environments, Slinky helps bring together the best of both worlds for efficient resource management and scheduling.

Slinky is made by `SchedMD <https://schedmd.com/>`_, the lead developers of Slurm.

   and Slurm workloads within the same cluster.
